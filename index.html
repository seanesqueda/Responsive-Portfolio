            <img src="./Assets/Images/Profile Picture.png" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>My name is Sean, and I am twenty-three years old from Garden Grove, California.
                I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Bioengineering from University of California, Riverside.
                My interests include hip-hop dancing, baseball, and gaming.</p>

            <p>My father is Mexican and my mother is Chinese. I have one younger sister.
                My father's side of the family lives in California and Florida, while my mother's side all live in the
                Phillipines.</p>

            <p>I currently work as an admin at a printer company, but am looking to further my career in the software
                industry.
                There are many things to do, and I look foward to whatever comes in the future!</p>
